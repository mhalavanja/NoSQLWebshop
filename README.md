# Web Shop

Final project for an Advanced Data Bases class written in PHP using MongoDB and Neo4j. The project is focused on a functionality and DB model design. It is a web shop with some functionalities including:
- Creating an account and verifying it via email
- Adding things you wish to sell at a certain price
- Buying things from other people
- Checking ratings and reviews of items, leaving a rating and a review for things you bought
- Recommending friends and changing your personal data
- Logging in as an administrator and checking who recommended whom.

This project includes a short paper written in Croatian that is not on GitHub but if you are interested in it, I will be happy to provide it.
